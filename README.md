1. Develop a class that allows you to perform calculations on Euclid's GCD algorithm for two, three, etc. integers (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm). Class methods in addition to the calculation of the GCD should determine the value of the time required to perform the calculation. Add to develop a class of techniques that implement the Stein algorithm (binary Euclidean algorithm) to calculate the GCD of two, three, etc. integers (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_GCD_algorithm). Methods must also determine the value of time needed to perform the calculations. Develop unit-tests to test methods of this type.
2. Implement the algorithm of "bubble" sort-rectangular integer array (System.Array class sorting methods did not use) so as to be able to order the rows:

* in ascending order (descending) of amounts of elements rows of the matrix;
* in ascending order (descending) of maximal elements of the rows of the matrix;
* in ascending order (descending) of minimal elements of matrix rows.
